[NOTE]
====
It's in beta version (API and defaults may change) while I don't get enough
response that everything works as expected.

To try out, install in your preferred way, then enable a lighter by
`:HighEnable <C-D>`.

To enable lighters by default, add the preferred ones to `g:high_lighter` as a
dictionary in your _.vimrc_, like this:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ '_': {                                                                  <1>
\   'blacklist': ['help', 'qf', 'lf', 'vim-plug'],                        <2>
\ },
\ 'inactive_window': {},                                                  <3>
\ 'indent': {'_hlgroupA': 'HighIndentA', '_hlgroupB': 'HighIndentB'},     <4>
\ 'long_line': {'hlgroup': 'DiffAdd'},
\ 'unite_directory': {},
\ 'your_custom_lighter': {'pattern': 'TODO\|NOTE', 'hlgroup': 'ErrorMsg'} <5>
\ }
----
<1> The `_` key means these settings will affect every lighter,
<2> for example all of them will be disabled in these filetypes.
<3> You can add predefined lighters, whose can be found in
    link:autoload/high/light/[] directory.
<4> To override the global settings, pass the lighter-specific ones in the
    dictionary.
<5> You can create your own lighters as you want.

== Override default settings

By default, every lighter in `g:high_lighters` are enabled at Vim startup, but
passing `'enabled': 0` will disable it. To use the lighter, call `:HighEnable
lighter` or `:HighToggle lighter`.

The available configuration parameters can be found in link:plugin/high.vim[]
as `g:high.defaults`. Options starting with double underscore
(`__init_function` for example) are private and you shouldn't override those.
See `:help matchadd` for `pattern` and `priority`; `:highlight` for
possible values of `hlgroup`.

Some lighters have specific settings, starting with an underscore (`_length`
of link:autoload/high/light/long_line.vim[long_line] for example) are
lighter-specific, the underscore is used only to prevent conflicts with global
settings, but you can safely override those.

Do not fear to view the source files to get the possibilities, because there
is no help file for the plugin, link:autoload/high/light[source codes] and
link:test[test files] contains everything.

== Custom colors

To define your own `hlgroup`, take a look at `:help highlight`. Here are the
highlight groups of the example config, place it to your _.vimrc_:

[source,viml]
----
autocmd ColorScheme,VimEnter *
\ highlight! HighIndentA guibg=#002029 guifg=#063642 |
\ highlight! HighIndentB guibg=#003542 guifg=#063642
----

== Dynamic update of highlighters

Some lighters are based on Vim settings, for example
link:autoload/high/light/indent.vim[indent] uses `shiftwidth` to highlight the
indentation. The highlighting will follow the change of it only on certain
events (jumping to another window, switching buffer, etc.). To apply the new
settings automatically, you have to write an autocommand in your _.vimrc_:

[source,viml]
----
autocmd CursorHold *
\ let pos = winnr()
\ | windo call high#UpdateGroups()
\ | exe pos.'wincmd w'
----

It will update every lighter where the `__update_function` is set.

== Examples of user-defined highlight in Vim

For example, a very basic implentation of
https://github.com/Valloric/vim-operator-highlight[Valloric/vim-operator-highlight]
should looks like this:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ 'operator': {                                                            <1>
\   'pattern': '[-?+|*;:,<>&|!~%=)({}.\[\]]',                              <2>
\   'blacklist': ['help', 'markdown', 'qf', 'conque_term', 'diff', 'html', <3>
\                 'css', 'less', 'xml', 'sh', 'bash', 'notes', 'jinja'],
\   'hlgroup': 'Error',                                                    <4>
\ }}
----
<1> Add a name to the lighter (which is not in use),
<2> define the pattern to match,
<3> add whitelist/blacklist,
<4> choose a hlgroup from the existing ones.

=== Vim Netrw filetype coloring

The plugin can be used in another plugins, for example if you want to colorize
files by extension in Netrw (`:Explore`, `:edit ./`), then you can do
something like this:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ 'netrw_yaml': {
\   'whitelist': ['netrw'],
\   'pattern': '\v^([|│] )*\zs\f+\.yml',
\   'hlgroup': 'HighNetrwYaml',
\ },
\ 'netrw_asciidoc': {
\   'whitelist': ['netrw'],
\   'pattern': '\v^([|│] )*\zs\f+\.adoc',
\   'hlgroup': 'HighNetrwAsciidoc',
\ }}

autocmd ColorScheme,VimEnter *
\ highlight! HighNetrwYaml guifg=#ae9400 |
\ highlight! HighNetrwAsciidoc guifg=#dd3a00
----

Note that `^([|│] )*` part is needed by tree view (most right picture on the
screenshot).
